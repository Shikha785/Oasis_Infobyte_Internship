# Oasis Infobyte Internship - Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program! This README file will guide you through Task 1, which involves the classification of Iris flowers using machine learning techniques. Please read this document carefully to understand the task requirements and instructions.

## Task Overview

In this task, you will be working with the famous Iris flower dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers along with their species. Your objective is to build a machine learning model that can classify the iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is often used as a beginner's dataset for classification tasks.
It contains the following attributes:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)

The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, and you can access it from the file named `iris_dataset.csv`.

## Task Requirements

1. **Data Exploration:** Begin by loading the dataset and exploring its contents. Perform basic statistical analysis to gain insights into the data, such as mean, standard deviation, range, etc. Visualize the data using appropriate plots to understand the relationships between different features and their distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset if necessary, handle any missing values, and convert categorical variables (species) into numerical values for the model.

3. **Model Building:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Using appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g.,KNN,Logistic Regression etc.) and build the classification model using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.

5. **Documentation:** Including a summary of your approach and findings in this README file.
